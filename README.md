# Topic Modeling with TF\*IDF and LDA

These are my notebooks for the [I2A2](https://www.linkedin.com/company/institut-i2a2/) Topic Modeling presentation assignment. I used common NLP preprocessing techniques (stopword removal, lemmatization), bag of words, TF\*IDF, LDA, common metrics like perplexity & coherence and visualization tools like wordclouds and pyLDAvis.
